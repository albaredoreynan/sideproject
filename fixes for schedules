Please update the “Schedules” app with a print option.  No need to do it now.  There may be other suggestions by the lawyers as we use the app.

Also for the Schedule entry form, it should default to the lawyer using it.

For the time in the Schedule Entry Form, for meetings and hearings, there should also be a start time and end time.

In the sched title, include Telecon as an item.

If the Timesheet app is ok, can it notify the user of an upcoming hearing, meeting or deadline?

When we click the weekly view, there is no back button to return to monthly view. 

Provide printing or saving in pdf.
